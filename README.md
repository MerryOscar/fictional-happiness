# testaudioplayers

A simple flutter project to test the [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) package:

### Working:
- :white_check_mark: download an audio file from the internet and play locally on the device.
- :white_check_mark: skip forward and back by 30 seconds from in-app controls.

Not Working:
- :x: skip forward and back by 30 seconds from lockscreen controls.
    - skips forward and back by 30 milliseconds instead of 30 seconds...
